Consider adding a function that integrates the action of a path?

Make worldlines really continuous?


In light of my new understanding of four-vectors and four-velocity, I should
make a few changes.

  * I don't think `st.boost`'s `velocity` argument is really necessary anymore,
    since we can actually transform a four-velocity if it's part of the `event`
    argument. It may be useful to have a three-velocity boosting function, but it
    should really be separate from `st.boost`, I think.

  * Related to the previous point, `st.boost`'s `event` argument should really be something
    more general, like `four_vector` or something. A four-velocity is not an event, but
    the function can still boost it.
